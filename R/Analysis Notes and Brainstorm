How do Members use Cyclistic vs Casual Riders?
- Ride Length (Members have shorter rides)
- Who rides more often?
- Who rides farthest distance?
- Are there time of day preferences?
- Are they day of week preferences?
- Are there month of year/season of year preferences?
- Are there opportunities for new stations that could increase new memberships
  - Specifically, are members frequently stopping and starting at particular non-station hot-spots?


Brain storming... with fellow data nerds.

So far I have Ride Length (how long the rides were), spliced and sliced.

I need the same for number of rides. 

What would it look like to do "distance" from one station to another?

Can we do time of day?

What does it mean to use this in R >

Predictive Models: You could potentially build models in R to predict the likelihood of a casual rider converting into a member.

What would it look like if we took non-stations out of the mix and looked for most popular top-five stations for casual and top-five stations for members?

What would it look like if we mapped stations with size by most visited, excluding non-stations?

What would it look like if we mapped most frequent start-stop sites with non-stations only, for potential new station spots?

What would it look like if we determined:



**Brain Storming Session with GPT-4**

-- Transformations:

Time-Based Features: Extracting hour, day, week, month, or season from the Start and End dates can help analyze riding patterns.

Duration of Rides: Calculating the duration of each ride using the Start and End times to understand usage patterns.

Distance Between Stations: If you have lat-long details, you can calculate the distance between start and stop stations.

Rider Classification: Categorize data into member and casual groups to perform comparative analyses.

-- Potential Insights:

Riding Patterns: Analyze riding habits across different times of the day, week, or month to see if members and casual riders show distinct patterns.

Duration Insights: Members might take longer or shorter rides than casual riders. Understanding these patterns can help tailor membership offers.

Geographical Preferences: Analyzing the popular start and stop stations can reveal where most rides occur for both members and casual riders.

Seasonal Trends: Understanding how the riding behavior changes with seasons might unveil marketing opportunities for membership drives.
